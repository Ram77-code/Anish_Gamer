I challenged myself to build a modern version of Tic-Tac-Toe — but not just a basic one.

So I added:

✅ 3 AI Difficulty Levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)  
✅ Unbeatable AI Logic  
✅ Live Scoreboard  
✅ Animated Win-Line (SVG)  
✅ Sound Effects Toggle  
✅ Fully Responsive UI  
✅ Dynamic Canvas Background  

Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks.

The hardest part?  
Designing the AI logic and handling different difficulty behaviors cleanly.

This project helped me improve:
• Game state management  
• DOM manipulation  
• AI thinking logic  
• UI structuring & animations  

Try beating Hard mode if you can 👀
